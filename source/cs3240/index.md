### First Day of Class

** *`First`* Discussion Session :** Wed Sep 27, 6 - 7 PM `(free snacks!)`

Hi I'm Looloo. I'll be your supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader for this quarter. I am a proud member of this great organization called SCAA (Student Center for Academic Achievement).

I took CS 3560 Intro to Systems Programming with Professor Stalica last quarter. Professor Stalica is extremely awesome, super chill and helpful. I really look forward to work with him to help you learn and succeed in this course.

Professor Stalica is currently working on giving me access to BlackBoard for this course. Once I can access this course on BlackBoard, I will send out Google forms for the meeting time, as well as future logistics informatin via emails to all of you.

For now, it is highly adviced that you mark down the URL for this website. Throughout this quarter, I will put up discussion session materials on this page.

About myself, I am a graduate student in Computer Science. This is my third quarter here at CSUEB. I took my Data Structures and Algorithms last quarter with Dr. Varick Erickson. If you would like to know more about me, feel free to click on the About tab. This is my personal blog that is not yet populated.

Data Structures and Algorithms is an extremely important course for CS majors because the knowledge and skills that you gain from this course will be applicable throughout your career course.

I will be hosting discussion session twice a week (one discussion session per lecture). Around Midterm and Final, I will also be hosting extra review sessions to help you prepare for the exams.

For more information, please come to the first meeting next Wednesday. I will be covering logistics, review or preview of the first lecture, LeetCode fun problems and more!
